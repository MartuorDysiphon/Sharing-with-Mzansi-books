**Introduction to "Mzansi My Python"**

Welcome to "Mzansi My Python," a journey through the world of Python programming, brought to you by Katlego MJ. 
This book is a reflection of my passion for Python, nurtured both during my studies at university and countless hours 
of self-learning at home. While this is not a full published book, it is a labor of love, aiming to make Python accessible 
and enjoyable for everyone.
