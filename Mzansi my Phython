**Chapter 2: Getting Started with Python**

In this chapter, we lay the foundation for your Python journey by guiding you through the essential steps to get started with Python programming.
We'll explore the installation process, set up your Python interpreter, and write your very first Python program.

**1. Installing Python**
Before we dive into coding, we need to ensure you have Python installed on your computer. We'll provide step-by-step instructions on how to download and install the latest Python version from the official website.
Additionally, we'll cover the differences between Python 2 and Python 3, emphasizing the significance of choosing Python 3 for your projects.

**2. Python Interpreter**
With Python installed, we'll introduce you to the Python interpreter, the powerful tool that executes your Python code. We'll show you how to access the Python interpreter in your terminal or command prompt and demonstrate
how to execute simple commands interactively.

**3. Writing Your First Python Program**
It's time to take your first step into the world of coding with Python! We'll guide you through the process of creating a "Hello, World!" programâ€”a time-honored tradition for beginners in programming. This simple yet significant 
program will give you a glimpse of Python's elegance and simplicity.

**4. Variables and Data Types**
In Python, variables play a crucial role in storing and manipulating data. We'll introduce the concept of variables and discuss how to assign values to them. Furthermore, we'll explore the various data types Python supports, including strings,
integers, floats, lists, tuples, and more. Understanding data types is fundamental to writing efficient and robust code.

**5. Basic Operations**
Python offers a wide range of arithmetic and logical operations. In this section, we'll delve into performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Moreover, we'll explore logical operators that
enable you to make decisions based on conditions.

**6. Getting User Input**
Interactivity is an essential aspect of programming. We'll teach you how to obtain user input using the `input()` function, allowing your Python programs to interact with users in real-time.

**7. Putting It All Together: Simple Projects**
To reinforce your learning, we'll conclude this chapter with simple projects that combine the concepts covered so far. These projects will give you the opportunity to apply what you've learned and start building practical Python programs.


In Chapter 2, "Getting Started with Python," we'll walk through the steps needed to get you up and running with Python programming.

**Step 1: Installing Python**
1. Visit the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Choose the latest Python 3.x version available for your operating system (e.g., Python 3.9.6).
3. Download the installer and run it.
4. During installation, make sure to check the option to add Python to the system PATH (Windows) or configure the PATH manually (macOS and Linux). This enables you to run Python from the terminal or command prompt easily.

**Step 2: Verifying Installation**
1. Open a terminal (Linux and macOS) or command prompt (Windows).
2. Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed correctly.

**Step 3: Python Interpreter**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `python` and press Enter. This will launch the Python interpreter, where you can enter Python commands and see the results immediately.

**Step 4: Writing Your First Python Program**
1. Open a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and create a new file named `hello.py`.
2. In the `hello.py` file, type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

3. Save the file.

**Step 5: Running Your Python Program**
1. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `hello.py` is located.
   - On Windows, you can use the `cd` command to change directories.
   - On macOS and Linux, use the `cd` command as well.
2. Type `python hello.py` and press Enter. You should see the output "Hello, World!" displayed in the terminal.

**Step 6: Variables and Data Types**
1. Open the Python interpreter by typing `python` in the terminal or command prompt.
2. Let's start by declaring variables and assigning values to them:

```python
name = "Katlego"
age = 25
height = 1.75
```

3. You've just created three variables: `name`, `age`, and `height`. The first variable stores a string, the second an integer, and the third a float.

**Step 7: Basic Operations**
1. In the Python interpreter, you can perform arithmetic operations:

```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
result_add = num1 + num2
result_sub = num1 - num2
result_mul = num1 * num2
result_div = num1 / num2

print(result_add)  # Output: 15
print(result_sub)  # Output: 5
print(result_mul)  # Output: 50
print(result_div)  # Output: 2.0 (Note: Python 3 returns a float for division)
```

**Step 8: Getting User Input**
1. In a new Python file, let's create a simple program that takes user input and prints a personalized greeting:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

2. Save the file and run it with `python filename.py`. The program will prompt you to enter your name, and it will print a personalized greeting with your name.

That's it! You've completed Chapter 2, and you're now familiar with the basics of Python, variables, data types, basic operations, and getting user input. You're well on your way to becoming a Python pro!
